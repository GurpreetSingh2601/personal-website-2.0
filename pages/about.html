    <h2>Below is a paragraph about me</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Computer programming</strong> always seems interesting to me whether it is used to <em>developing web pages</em>
        or writing basic codes that <strong>calculate taxes</strong> and do some basic mathematical problems such as
        converting inches to centimeters. I also <em>love cooking</em> whenever possible I also try to enhance my <em>cooking</em>
        <em>skill passion</em> and <em>computer programming skills</em>. You'll find me playing video games and sleeping most of the time !!!!. Currently I am
        focusing on my computer skills so I decided to study <strong>Computer Information Technology</strong> from <strong>BCIT</strong>.
